#### D.Pharm Admission 2025 Process

The admission process can vary by state and college, but it generally follows one of two methods:

* **Merit-Based:** Many colleges and state-level authorities admit students based on their marks in the 12th-grade examination. A merit list is prepared from the applicants, and seats are allotted during a counseling process.
* **Entrance Exam:** Some universities and state bodies conduct their own entrance exams. For example, in Maharashtra, admission to some colleges may be based on a non-zero score in the **MHT-CET** or **NEET**. After the exam, a merit list is released, and qualified candidates attend counseling to secure a seat.
