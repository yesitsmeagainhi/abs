faqs:
  - question: What is BPT and what does a physiotherapist do?
    answer: BPT stands for Bachelor of Physiotherapy, a 4.5-year undergraduate
      program designed to train students in physical rehabilitation, injury
      recovery, and therapeutic exercises. After completing BPT, graduates
      become physiotherapists, professionals who help patients restore mobility,
      manage pain, and improve physical functions after surgeries, sports
      injuries, or neurological disorders. Physiotherapists work in hospitals,
      rehabilitation centers, private clinics, sports organizations, and
      wellness centers.
  - question: " How many years is the BPT course and what is its structure?"
    answer: The BPT course duration is 4.5 years, which includes 4 years of academic
      study and 6 months of compulsory clinical internship. The curriculum
      covers core subjects like Human Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Exercise
      Therapy, and Biomechanics, along with hands-on training in hospitals and
      physiotherapy clinics. This combination of theory and practical learning
      ensures students become skilled in diagnosing and treating a variety of
      physical conditions.
  - question: How can I apply for a BPT course in India?
    answer: To apply for a BPT program in India, candidates must have completed 12th
      grade with Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (PCB). Some universities accept
      NEET scores, while others conduct separate entrance exams or offer direct
      admissions based on 12th-grade marks. Application is usually done online
      through college websites or centralized admission portals. It’s important
      to research college eligibility criteria and application deadlines
      beforehand.
  - question: What subjects are taught in the BPT course?
    answer: >-
      The BPT curriculum is a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical
      training. Subjects include:


      Anatomy & Physiology – Human body structure and function

      Biochemistry & Pathology – Chemical processes and disease analysis

      Exercise Therapy & Electrotherapy – Techniques to treat pain and mobility issues

      Biomechanics & Kinesiology – Study of human movement

      Orthopedics & Neurology – Diagnosis and rehab of musculoskeletal and nervous system disorders

      This course also includes clinical postings, case studies, and real-time patient handling for hands-on experience.
  - question: What is the starting salary of a BPT graduate in India?
    answer: The starting salary after completing BPT in India ranges between ₹2.5 to
      ₹4 lakhs per annum, depending on location, specialization, and the
      employer (hospital, clinic, or sports team). With experience,
      certifications, or a Master’s in Physiotherapy (MPT), professionals can
      earn significantly more. Private practice and international opportunities
      can further enhance earnings.
  - question: Can a BPT graduate open a private physiotherapy clinic?
    answer: Yes, after obtaining a BPT degree and state council registration,
      graduates can open their own physiotherapy clinic. Many successful
      physiotherapists run private practices, offering services like sports
      injury treatment, pain management, post-surgery rehab, and geriatric
      physiotherapy. A BPT graduate can also collaborate with fitness centers,
      yoga studios, and rehabilitation homes to offer specialized therapies.
  - question: Is NEET compulsory for BPT admission?
    answer: NEET is not mandatory for all BPT colleges in India. While some states
      or government colleges may consider NEET scores, most private universities
      and institutes conduct their own entrance tests or provide admission based
      on Class 12th PCB marks. Students are advised to check with individual
      colleges for specific admission requirements.
  - question: Is BPT a good career choice in India?
    answer: Yes, BPT is a highly rewarding and growing career path, especially with
      the rise in awareness about physical health, fitness, and recovery.
      Physiotherapists are in demand in multispecialty hospitals, rehabilitation
      centers, elderly care facilities, sports academies, and even international
      healthcare settings. BPT graduates can also pursue higher studies,
      research, or open their own practice, making it a flexible and
      future-proof profession.
  - question: Can I pursue BPT without Mathematics in 12th?
    answer: Absolutely. Mathematics is not required for admission into BPT. Students
      only need to have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (PCB) in their
      12th grade. This makes the course accessible for students from a biology
      background who are interested in the healthcare field but don’t want to
      take up MBBS or BDS.
  - question: "Which is a better career: BPT or Nursing?"
    answer: >-
      Both BPT and Nursing are noble and essential healthcare careers, but they
      differ in roles and scope.


      BPT focuses on rehabilitation, physical therapy, and improving movement.


      Nursing involves overall patient care, medication administration, and hospital support.

      BPT may be more suitable for those interested in anatomy, movement science, and hands-on therapy, while Nursing may appeal to those who want to work directly in clinical care settings. Career choice depends on your interests, strengths, and long-term goals.
